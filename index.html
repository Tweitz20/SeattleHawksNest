                <p>If Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has his way, he'll be a staple in the NFL for generations to come. 
                    On Monday, the eight-time Pro Bowler said he wants to play "20-plus years" and own an NFL team after his career is over. While he wasn't clear whether those 20-plus years include the time he spent at NC State and Wisconsin, Wilson is only in his 10th NFL season, meaning there's still a ways to go.

                    Coming off Sunday's loss in Green Bay, the Seahawks executed a pair of moves shaking up their practice squad.

On Monday, Seattle re-signed second-year tight end Tyler Mabry, who was released off of the 53-man roster last Friday to make room for the activation of quarterback Russell Wilson and receiver Dee Eskridge from injured reserve. To create room for him on the practice squad, quarterback Jake Luton was released.
In an additional roster move, the Seahawks released defensive end Alex Tchangam from the practice squad and replaced him with veteran linebacker Edmond Robinson, who worked out for the team on Tuesday.
Mabry, who joined the Seahawks as an undrafted free agent out of Maryland prior to the 2020 season, spent the entirety of his rookie year on the practice squad. The 6-foot-4, 248-pound tight end opened this season on the active roster with Colby Parkinson recovering from a broken foot and has dressed for three games this season, logging six snaps on offense and 26 snaps on special teams.
