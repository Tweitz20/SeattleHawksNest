                <p>If Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has his way, he'll be a staple in the NFL for generations to come. 
                    On Monday, the eight-time Pro Bowler said he wants to play "20-plus years" and own an NFL team after his career is over. While he wasn't clear whether those 20-plus years include the time he spent at NC State and Wisconsin, Wilson is only in his 10th NFL season, meaning there's still a ways to go.
